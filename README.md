# DesktopBroadcast
Broadcasts desktop to android phone (like vnc/rdp) but supposed to be used as VR for google cardboard. When desktop screen shows left-right picture.

Stage1: do pure broadcast of desktop to anroid (linux). When this done should be possible to watch VR movies by capturing VLC screen and sending to phone.

Stage2: do some additional protocol to send sensor's data from phone back to desktop

Laters: 

- enable win/macos support compilation(code is there from another lib already)
- possibly will need some "virtual" devices so games can receive sensors data we send.
